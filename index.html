                    Hello GitHub, I’m <a href="http://swilliams.me">Scott Williams</a>. I’ve been working professionally for over 10 years, and as a consultant for the last 5. I realized that <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2013/5/14/fear-of-falling-fear-of-failing-fear-of-rejection">I needed a change</a> and am looking for a new job. Right now, you’re my <strong>number one</strong> pick. That isn’t BS, and this isn’t some auto-generated page where I swap out company names. I’ve been following you guys since your inception (<a href="https://github.com/swilliams">joined</a> 9/2008), and based on <a href="http://julieannhorvath.com/2013/04/23/one-year-at-github.html">pretty</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/holman/status/303576839132164097">much</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/haacked/status/308253031709958144">everything</a> I read about you, I think we’d be a terrific match.</p>

<p>I love to create stuff, and based on some other GitHubbers I see, that's pretty common. Professionally, my outlet has been code, code, code. But I also have dipped my toes into a bit of design, <a href="http://swilliamsphoto.com">photography</a>, and <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me">writing</a>. I believe in the power of iteration; it’s how stuff just gets better. I see this in practice at GitHub, and want to be a part of it.</p>

<p>I see that you're looking for an <a href="https://jobs.github.com/positions/00736bb8-b9c5-11e2-9e6c-6a6bc47feb5b">Internal Tools Developer</a>. Given my experience I think I'd be well suited for the job. As a consultant, most of my work has been in the area of internal tools. I'm well experienced with talking to clients to understand their business domain, working with sales staff, and then talking with end users to determine if there are any rough edges that need to be smoothed.</p>


<p>I am always discontent with the present state of things, and want to make them better. It <em>grieves</em> me when I have to let some technical debt slide. However, I do believe that shipping is a better neuroses to have than perfection. I’m not afraid to fight for what I believe will be a better solution, but I don't have too much pride to admit when I’m wrong.</p>

                            This was my baby. It was a startup that I founded and worked on from 2010 to 2012. My partner and I had a great relationship, got some advisors, informally talked with some VCs (didn’t take any money), and iterated on our designs. We got all the way up to our first beta, and had some serious interest from professional photographers when life intervened and time ran out to ship it.

                            <p>Lesson learned: Time is precious, and you can’t do both a day job and startup at 100%.</p>

                            Specifically, I gather requirements for a feature, talk with the analysts, create wireframes, groom and plan them with the rest of the team, then either implement them myself or work with the developer who does. I also created the client side APIs and wrote the style guide documentation.

                            <p>In 2012, my employer “encouraged” all the consultants to get a Microsoft certification. I’m trying to keep it family friendly here, so I’m not gonna say how I feel about certs. But, in order to procrastinate studying I made an iPad app (and server architecture) to create flashcards as a study aid. From the management console on the server I could create and edit different flashcard decks. It had a simple JSON API that was consumed by the iPad app. I deployed it internally to other consultants.</p>

One of my hobbies is photography and I wanted to setup my iMac as a <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/how-i-setup-a-photobooth">photobooth</a> with a spare DSLR, have it take a picture and then display it on the Mac’s big screen. It’s kind of tied together with chewing gum and tape, but it works, and everyone who’s used it has loved it. I’d love to release it publicly, but there’s a licensing headache with some of the stuff I used. I could fix it all in a rewrite, but there’s that whole time thing, y’know? <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/how-i-setup-a-photobooth">Read more on my blog.</a></p>

                    <blockquote>Scott is an immensely talented and proficient web developer. His capacity to develop compelling web interfaces with solid coding strategies and breadth of tools makes discovering his code and techniques a memorable activity. He also teaches and mentors with clarity.

                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>Scott’s deep knowledge on a variety of technologies and methodologies was invaluable during our infancy. It was important to have someone like Scott who could challenge the team and push us to something greater. Scott possesses the rare combination of intelligence, humor, integrity, and a solid work ethic.

                    <blockquote>Scott was an incredibly valuable member of the team to deliver the internal system for LifeLock's custom enterprise CRM system. He took ownership of the architecture/builds for integrating LifeLock's java-based service bus with the 3 .Net UI tiers. Scott went above and beyond working extra hours to meet a very aggressive project schedule and raised issues in a proactive manner.

                    <blockquote>In my opinion, Scott has done an amazing job keeping his skills up to date. On the project, Scott was instrumental in the evaluation and selection of the client-side technologies we have used in the project. On [the project], Scott was the leader in teaching both the Neudesic and client developers about Coffeescript, Backbone.js, Jasmine, Handlebars and other client side technologies we use everyday.

                    <blockquote>Scott has a strong grasp of technology and stays current with the latest tools and technologies. These skills have been applied to the project. He is a technical resource to others and has spent time outside of work learning topics such as Node.js and iOS development. [He] saw a need for a UX role and stepped into that leadership position. He has been able to handle the pressure of a highly-visible role that has required making tough decisions. He lead team members through the UI framework changes giving them both the vision and technical details to succeed.

                    <h2>What Do I Want?</h2>
                    <p>
                    Most of my professional career so far has used .NET. I think .NET is a good platform, but I feel like it's time to move on. I've been spending my free time in Rails (built Shootsy on it) and iOS and would like to continue on that route. I am not as good at those two technologies as I am at .NET, but that's only due to experience. I'll be great at both soon enough.
                    </p>
                    <p>At GitHub I'll be able to use the stuff I <em>want</em> to use to make some awesome software that people will use to do even more greatness.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the hardest part of making this has been to know exactly what to put on here, and what to leave on the cutting room floor (did you know I was also a Technical Advisor for a non-profit startup?). I'd love to chat with you guys some more about everything.</p>
                    <p>I know you only hire the best, and I hope I fit your criteria. Give me a call, or an email and let me know!</p>
